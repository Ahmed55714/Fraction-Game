# Fraction Game

Fraction is an interactive learning game built with Flutter. The game teaches players about fractions by requiring them to select the correct portion of a grid. The goal is to allow players to practice selecting fractions visually and to receive feedback through interactive animations.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay:** Players tap on the grid to select squares that correspond to the fraction displayed.
- **Dynamic Grid:** The grid size changes with each question, with rows and columns generated randomly.
- **Progress Tracking:** A progress bar keeps track of the player's progress through the game.
- **Visual Feedback:** Correct selections are highlighted in green, and animations celebrate correct answers.
- **Celebration Animations:** Enjoy beautifully designed Lottie animations after correct answers and at the end of each round.
